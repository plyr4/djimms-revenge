Check out the web demo! https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/djimms-revenge

After accidentally summoning **Djimm the Evil Djinn** you must battle him for his precious wishes!

Throw apples to deter evil spirits, and collect three wishes to escape the **evil Djinn**. Wishes will arrive, but not as quickly as evil spirits!

You **LOSE** if you touch an EVIL BLUE SPIRIT! (balls that slowly grow and multiply)

You **WIN** if you can collect THREE wishes! (stars that slowly appear)

Don't let **Djimm the Evil Djinn** collect **YOU**!

**Controls**:

Move: WASD/Left-Joystick

Jump: Space/A

Throw: Click/Right-Trigger (HOLD for more power)

**Post-Publish Changes**:

- Retry flow
- Added builds for WebGL, macOS, linux

**Known Issues**:
- Sound controls not always working
- Collisions can be wonky
- Lighting restrictions on WebGL
